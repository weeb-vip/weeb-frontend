# Astro Migration - Next Steps

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Install Astro Dependencies
```bash
npm install astro @astrojs/react @astrojs/tailwind @astrojs/node
```

### 2. Update Existing React Components
The existing React components in `src/components/` should work as-is when used as islands. However, you may need to:

- Ensure all components have proper default exports
- Check for any server-side incompatible code (like `window` access)
- Update imports if components are moved

### 3. Test the Migration

#### Development Testing
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test these pages:
# http://localhost:8083/ (Homepage - SSG)
# http://localhost:8083/airing (Currently Airing - SSG)
# http://localhost:8083/show/123 (Show Details - SSR)
# http://localhost:8083/profile (Profile - SSR)
# http://localhost:8083/auth/login (Login - SSR)
```

#### Build Testing
```bash
# Test production build
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### 4. Verify Core Functionality

- [ ] Homepage loads with anime listings
- [ ] Navigation works between pages
- [ ] Show details page loads with dynamic routes
- [ ] Authentication flow works
- [ ] Toast notifications appear
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness maintained
- [ ] Dark mode switching works
- [ ] PWA functionality (service worker registration)

### 5. Performance Validation

Compare before/after metrics:
- Bundle size (should be ~60% smaller initial JS)
- Time to Interactive
- First Contentful Paint
- Core Web Vitals scores

### 6. SEO Testing

- Check meta tags on different pages
- Validate OpenGraph previews
- Test search engine rendering

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Import Errors
**Solution**: Update import paths for moved components

### Issue: Hydration Mismatches
**Solution**: Ensure server/client rendering consistency

### Issue: Service Worker Conflicts
**Solution**: Clear existing service worker cache

### Issue: TypeScript Errors
**Solution**: Update `tsconfig.json` for Astro compatibility

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can quickly rollback by:
1. Reverting to original `package.json`
2. Using original `vite.config.js`
3. Removing Astro-specific files

The original React components and structure remain intact, making rollback safe.

## Production Deployment

1. **Staging Deployment**: Deploy to staging first
2. **Performance Testing**: Validate improvements
3. **Feature Testing**: Ensure all functionality works
4. **Gradual Rollout**: Deploy to production with monitoring

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] All pages load without errors
- [ ] JavaScript bundle size reduction achieved
- [ ] Core Web Vitals improved
- [ ] SEO metadata properly generated
- [ ] PWA functionality maintained

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the `ASTRO_MIGRATION.md` documentation
2. Review Astro's migration guides
3. Test individual React islands in isolation
4. Validate server-side rendering vs client-side behavior
